Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language that describes how a markup language is actually displayed [1].
It is mainly used in HTML and XHTML, and can also be used in XML. It is a W3C standard,
and the degree of freedom in defining layout and style is high.

CSS is responsible for decorating it like clothes and accessories. In other words,
you can decorate a website like a completely different website by changing the CSS file while leaving the HTML structure intact.
